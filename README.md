# RNAStructureIdentifier
A Mathematica package for identifying the target secondary structure from RNA structure ensemble.

Amongst other things, our implementations allow you to:

- compute the ensemble tree, a hierarchical bi-partition of the ensemble of structures
- calculate the base pairs having maximum information entropy
- predict the target structure via recursively querying about whether or not
	a base pair of maximum entropy is contained in the target
- visualize the ensemble tree, together with base pairs of maximum entropy
- draw a single secondary structure as a diagram
- present an ensemble of secondary structures as a greyscale diagram

## Installation

To load the package, the only thing you need to install is Wolfram Mathematica.[Free Trial](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/trial/)
